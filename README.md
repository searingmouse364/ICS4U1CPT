# VAULTS

Vaults is a simple GUI-based application that allows you to group multiple files into a single archive-like file called a "vault", similar to ZIP files. It enables easy compression, extraction, and management of grouped files using a clean interface.

## Features

- Compress multiple files into a single vault
- Extract specific or all files from a vault
- Add files to existing vaults
- Built-in file explorer with search functionality

## Getting Started

1. **Download and Extract**  
   Download the `.zip` file from GitHub and extract its contents.

2. **Run the Application**  
   Open a terminal or double-click `main.py` in the top-level directory.

3. **Install Dependencies (if needed)**  
   If you are missing dependencies, a popup will guide you to install them.

Once launched, the main interface will appear, allowing you to manage vaults easily.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
